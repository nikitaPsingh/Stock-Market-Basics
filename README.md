### LTCG and Dividend

- LTCG - Long term capital gain : If a person holds a share for more than one year and earns a profit it is known as LTCG.

- Dividend : Return on investment in shares.

> It's the company's decision whether to declare the dividend or not or it's not mandatory to give dividend unlike Interest.

- Dividend and LTCG are tax free for individuals. 

> Subject to limits

> limit for divident - 10,00,000 and above that 10%

> limit for LTCG - 1,00,000 and above that 10%

-> Interest is given on Fixed deposits in banks

### Promoter

- Promoter is a person who starts the company

- Promoter of Reliance company is Dhirubai Ambani.

- There can be multiple Promoters.

### Share Certificate

- Share certificate includes Name of the shareholder, Face value (decided by the Promoters), Number of shares (Amount invested divided by the face value).

- Shareholders get a share certificate.

- In physical format or Demat format.

> Demat - Dematerialized securities : For companies that are listed.

-> Annual Report : Report of the company.

> Gives information about number of physical or Dematerialized formats.

### Face Value

- Face value can be different for different companies and is decided by the promoters of the company.
- Value returned on the face of the document.
- FV will atleast be 1 and in multiple of one's
- Remains constant unless there is a stock split
  
-> a pvt ltd company converts to public ltd (or ltd) when there are more investors (or shareholders) other than the promoters.

-> pvt ltd company --> public ltd company --> listed company

-> Turnover is basically Sales

-> Profit before Tax = turnover - expenses

### Topline and Bottomline

- Topline means Turnover

- Bottomline means Profit after Tax

- Usually profit increases with turnover. But Profit might decrease even with increase in Turnover when expenses increase out of proportion.

### STOCK SPLIT 

- The moment stock splits from 2 to 1 --> Face value halved --> number of shares doubles --> Market value halved (not necessarily half, can be any other value)

- Therefore, stock splits --> Face value decreases --> number of shares increases proportionately --> Market value decreases proportionately.

> Example:

| | Original | Revised |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
FV | 2 | 1 |
Shares| 50000 | 100000 |
Value| 100000 | 100000 |


- Value is intact
     
- Stock splits so that Market price decreases and more people can buy the shares (increase liquidity). It's neither good nor bad.
